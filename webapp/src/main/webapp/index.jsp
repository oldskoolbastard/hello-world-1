<h2> Just learning Ci/CD and i am just checking the webhooks are working or not thriugh jenkins. and i feel like i have made the flawlee
    CI/CD pipeline and ia m ready to work with this </h2>
<h2> Okay , So i have integrated docker hub and jenkins with ansible as well. now if i am going to
commit this file to github it will automatically get trigger by jenkins and jenkins will start to build this app
and then controller server will make an image from this war file via dockerfile that is in controllerserver
and after image is build it will be pushed to the dockerhub and will be deleted from the controller server and after the image is pushed to the dockerhubthen another server will pull this exact image and run the container from this image.
and we will bge able to see our app in browser.Okay so lets commit these changes in github </h2>
